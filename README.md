3D Sneaker Viewer
Overview
Welcome to the 3D Sneaker Viewer project, a collaborative effort with Chr1stopherPerez on GitHub! In this joint venture, we've gone beyond the initial project requirements and proposed a 3D viewing experience for a sneaker using the Three.js library for 3D rendering and WebGL.

How to Use
Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Navigation
Zoom: Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
Rotate: Click and drag with the mouse to rotate the 3D model.
Pan: Hold down the right mouse button and drag to pan the view.
Background
The scene has a light gray background to enhance visibility and aesthetics.

Lighting
Key Light: Positioned to simulate the main light source, creating shadows and highlights.
Front Light: Additional light from the front to provide more visibility.
Ambient Light: Soft ambient light to illuminate the entire scene.
Camera Positioning
The camera is strategically positioned to offer an optimal view of the sneaker. It automatically adjusts based on the size of the loaded 3D model.

Sneaker Model
The 3D model of the sneaker is loaded using the GLTFLoader from the provided supreme2.glb file.

Customization
Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different 3D models, lighting configurations, and camera settings. This project serves as a collaborative effort to extend the initial requirements and propose an interactive 3D product viewer for Chr1stopherPerez on GitHub.
